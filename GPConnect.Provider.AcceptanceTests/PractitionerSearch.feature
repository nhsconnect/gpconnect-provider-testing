Feature: PractitionerSearch

# Common
# JWT is hard coded value and it should probably be considered what JWT requested resource should be, organization but which?
# Compress successful tests into one possibly // For clarity it may be better to keep successful seperated as if one failes it is easier to see where the problem is
Scenario Outline: Practitioner search success and validate the practitioner identifiers
	Given I configure the default "PractitionerSearch" request		
		And I add a Practitioner Identifier parameter with SDS User Id System and Value "<Value>"
