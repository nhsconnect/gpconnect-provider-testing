Feature: LocationRead

@1.2.3
Scenario Outline: Location read successful request validate the response contains logical identifier
	Given I set the Get Request Id to the Logical Identifier for Location "<Location>"
	Given I configure the default "LocationRead" request
	When I make the "LocationRead" request
	Then the response status code should indicate success
		And the Response Resource should be a Location
		And the Location Id should match the GET request Id
	Examples:
		| Location |
		| SIT1     |
		| SIT2     |
		| SIT3     |

Scenario Outline: Location Read with valid identifier which does not exist on providers system
	Given I configure the default "LocationRead" request
		And I set the Read Operation logical identifier used in the request to "<LogicalId>"
	When I make the "LocationRead" request
	Then the response status code should be "404"
	Examples:
		| LogicalId   |
		| mfpBm       |
		| 231Zcr64    |

Scenario Outline: Location Read using the _format parameter to request response format
	Given I set the Get Request Id to the Logical Identifier for Location "SIT1"
	Given I configure the default "LocationRead" request
		And I add a Format parameter with the Value "<Format>"
	When I make the "LocationRead" request
	Then the response status code should indicate success
		And the response should be the format FHIR <ResponseFormat>
		And the Response Resource should be a Location
		And the Location Id should equal the Request Id
		And the Location Identifier should be valid for Value "SIT1"
	Examples:
		| Format	            | ResponseFormat |
		| application/fhir+json | JSON           |
		| application/fhir+xml  | XML            |

	Given I set the Get Request Id to the Logical Identifier for Location "SIT3"
	Given I configure the default "LocationRead" request
		And I set the Accept header to "<Header>"
		And I add a Format parameter with the Value "<Format>"
	When I make the "LocationRead" request
	Then the response status code should indicate success
		And the response should be the format FHIR <ResponseFormat>
		And the Response Resource should be a Location
		And the Location Id should equal the Request Id
		And the Location Identifier should be valid for Value "SIT3"
	Examples:
		| Header                | Format                | ResponseFormat |

	When I make the "MetadataRead" request
	Then the response status code should indicate success
		And the CapabilityStatement REST Resources should contain the "Location" Resource with the "Read" Interaction

@1.2.3
Scenario Outline: Location read resource conforms to GP-Connect specification
	Given I set the Get Request Id to the Logical Identifier for Location "SIT2"
	Given I configure the default "LocationRead" request
		And I set the Accept header to "<Header>"
	When I make the "LocationRead" request
	Then the response status code should indicate success
		And the response body should be FHIR <BodyFormat>
		And the Response Resource should be a Location
		And the Location Id should equal the Request Id
		And the Location Identifier should be valid for Value "SIT2"
		And the Location Metadata should be valid
#		status // This is checked by the FHIR .NET library
		And the Location Type should be valid
		And the Location Telecom should be valid
#		address // This is checked by the FHIR .NET library
		And the Location Physical Type should be valid

Scenario: Location read should contain ETag
	Given I set the Get Request Id to the Logical Identifier for Location "SIT1"
	Given I configure the default "LocationRead" request
	When I make the "LocationRead" request
	Then the response status code should indicate success
		And the Response should contain the ETag header matching the Resource Version Id

Scenario: Location read valid response check caching headers exist
	Given I set the Get Request Id to the Logical Identifier for Location "SIT1"
	Given I configure the default "LocationRead" request
	When I make the "LocationRead" request
	Then the response status code should indicate success
		And the Response Resource should be a Location
		And the Location Id should match the GET request Id
		And the required cacheing headers should be present in the response

Scenario: Location read invalid response check caching headers exist
	Given I set the Get Request Id to the Logical Identifier for Location "SIT1"
