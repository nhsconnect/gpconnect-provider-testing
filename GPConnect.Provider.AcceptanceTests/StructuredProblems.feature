Scenario: Verify response for a Patient with Problems linked to all supported clinical item types
	Given I configure the default "GpcGetStructuredRecord" request
		And I add an NHS Number parameter for "patient2"

		And the patient resource in the bundle should contain meta data profile and version id
		And if the response bundle contains a practitioner resource it should contain meta data profile and version id

		And the Bundle should be valid for patient "patient2"
		And the Patient Id should be valid
		And the Practitioner Id should be valid
		And the Organization Id should be valid
