	Then the response status code should indicate success
		And the response should be a Bundle resource of type "collection"
		And the response meta profile should be for "structured"
		And the patient resource in the bundle should contain meta data profile and version id
		And if the response bundle contains a practitioner resource it should contain meta data profile and version id

	    | 0                     |
	    | 10                    |
		
Scenario: Search for Diary Entries with a Past Date Expect Fail
	Given I configure the default "GpcGetStructuredRecord" request
		And I add an NHS Number parameter for "patient2"
		Then I add the Diary Search date parameter with a past date "20" days ago
	When I make the "GpcGetStructuredRecord" request

		And the response should be a OperationOutcome resource with error code "INVALID_PARAMETER"

Scenario Outline: Search for Diary Entries with invalid date values
	Given I configure the default "GpcGetStructuredRecord" request
		And I add an NHS Number parameter for "patient1"
		And I set a Diary Search date to "<InvalidSearchDate>" 
	When I make the "GpcGetStructuredRecord" request
	Then the response status code should be "422"
